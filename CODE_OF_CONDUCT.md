## Our Commitment

We want CodebaseQA to be a welcoming, inclusive, and respectful project for everyone.
Contributors, maintainers, and community members are expected to act professionally in all project spaces.

## Expected Behavior

- Be respectful and constructive.
- Assume good intent and ask clarifying questions before escalating.
- Give feedback on ideas and code, not on people.
- Help keep discussions focused, useful, and inclusive.

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment, discrimination, hate speech, or personal attacks.
- Trolling, intimidation, doxxing, or sustained disruption.
- Sharing private information without explicit permission.
- Repeatedly derailing discussions or refusing to follow maintainer guidance.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code of Conduct.
They may remove comments, close threads, or restrict participation for behavior that violates this policy.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

- Open an issue titled `[CoC] <short description>` for non-sensitive cases.
- For sensitive/private reports, contact the maintainer directly:
  - GitHub: [@ShreeBohara](https://github.com/ShreeBohara)
  - LinkedIn: [Shree Bohara](https://linkedin.com/in/ShreeBohara)

All reports will be reviewed and handled as quickly and fairly as possible.
