# CodebaseQA v1.0.0

Launch release for CodebaseQA.

## TL;DR

CodebaseQA helps developers understand unfamiliar repositories faster using RAG chat with citations, guided learning paths, quizzes/challenges, and dependency graph exploration.

## Highlights

- Repository indexing pipeline with progress tracking
- Chat Q&A with hybrid retrieval and source-backed context
- Persona-based curriculum and lesson generation
- Quiz and challenge system with validation and scoring
- Gamification (XP, levels, streaks, achievements)
- Full-workspace dependency graph with export support
- CLI workflow for indexing, asking, searching, and lesson export

## Included in This Release

### Added

- Web UI for repository import, chat, learning, and graph exploration
- FastAPI backend for indexing, retrieval, and learning APIs
- CLI package for terminal-first workflows
- Demo mode flags and demo seed endpoint

### Improved

- README onboarding and launch-ready repository docs
- Community health standards (`CONTRIBUTING`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT`, `SECURITY`, `SUPPORT`)
- CI coverage for backend and frontend quality checks

### Fixed

- Re-index flow now clears stale SQL/vector index data before fresh indexing
- Hardened repository URL parsing and invalid input handling
- Documentation and environment variable alignment issues

## Verification

- Backend unit and integration tests passing
- Frontend lint, type-check, tests, and build passing
- CI workflow configured in GitHub Actions

## Known Limitations

- Very large repositories may still index slowly depending on provider and model
- Generation quality varies by selected model/provider and repository context
- OpenAI-first defaults in Docker unless additional provider vars are configured

## Upgrade Notes

- No breaking API changes intended for this initial public release
- Review `.env.example` for provider and demo mode configuration
